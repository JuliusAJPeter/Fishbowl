      <div class="intro"><p>Dialogos is an online tool designed to facilitate dialogue in large groups that communicate remotely.
        It can hosts up to 40 participants in a session that video streams 4 active speakers simultaneously.
        The core of Dialogos is in the approach of organising dialogues which is based on the fishbowl discussion method<sup>&#8224;</sup>.
        Dialogos was inspired by Unhangout, a tool designed by MIT University, USA</p>

      <div class="footnote"><p><sup>&#8224;</sup>A fishbowl conversation is a form of dialogue that allows the entire group to participate in a
        conversation where several people can be actively discussing at a time and others listening. The
        arrangement of the participants in a fishbowl session is layed out in the way that four people can
        be sitting in the inner space, or the fishbowl, and discussing. The audience outside the fishbowl,
        listen in on the discussion in a way that it is surrounding it. The placement of the chairs can be in
        concentric circles or similar formation. In a fishbowl discussion there is always one empty chair that
        can be taken over by someone who is willing to enter the fishbowl at any time. When this happens,
        an existing member of the fishbowl must voluntarily leave the fishbowl and free a chair. The
        discussion continues with participants frequently entering and leaving the fishbowl.</p>
